# bioperl-scripts
A few useful Perl/BioPerl bioinformatics scripts.
All require a working Perl installation (including core modules) and BioPerl (http://www.bioperl.org). They have only been
tested on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04), but may work on other platforms.

Run scripts without arguments for usage instructions.
Scripts are standalone and do not require installation, simply copy (or symlink) them to somewhere in your $PATH.
